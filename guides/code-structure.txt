Extension code based is split into modules.

Each module:
* is separate functional unit
* is independant - that means, can depend only on "core" module, which acts
  as common library of helper function and abstracts over platform the code is
  being run on
* can be enabled (asynchonously)
* can be disabled (synchonously)
* should be platform independant, platform specific code should be
  provided by "core" module and implemented in "platforms" folder
* communicate with other modules using "events" - that means, can react to
  events published by other modules and can publish own events, but cannot
  expect that any module will listen to them
* expose a public api called "actions"
* can call other module actions with assumption that those modules can be
  missing or disabled
* has maintainer, who should review changes to that module before merging
* should pass automatic code styleguide check
* can use bower provided dependency which is listed in module config file
* can use sass for stylesheet compilation
* can use handlerbars for templates compilation
* can use browserify to include node module
* should not call platform dependant APIs in UI
* should provide unit tests that will run in full isolation on nodejs
* having UI, should provide UI tests, that run on phantomjs
