Development process in Frontend department goes strongly in line with our project management practices.
It is bug tracker oriented, so all development should start with bug tracker ticket.

Process can be summarized in few steps:
* every developer forks upstream repository
* given a bug tracker ticket, developer creates new branch in local repository clone. Branch is named after the ticket, eg. EX-1245
  * commits to repository should have messages starting with bug tracker ticker name, eg. EX-1234: Adding feature X
  * branch should ideally have only one commit, so work should be squashed before pushing
  * once work is done, code changes, related tests and documentation are pushed to git remote clone
* a github pull request is created
  * developer assigns one or more reviewers to the PR
  * continuous integration starts automated test suits:
    * integration tests for supported versions of Firefox, that is 38+
    * unit tests, run on nodejs
    * ui tests, run on headless browser
    * mobile codebase integration tests, run on chromium
* pull request gets merged to master if all tests are green and all review are positive
  * changes gets rebased on top of upstream repository master branch
* once merged, changes are released on beta channel and manually tested by quality assurance team
