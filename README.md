# Browser Core

CLIQZ is available on multiple platforms: browsers for Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS (based on Mozilla/Firefox), as well as the CLIQZ browser for Android (based on Lightning). There's also the CLIQZ for Firefox browser extension. 

Browser Core is used in:

* [CLIQZ for Desktop](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-f)
* [CLIQZ for Android](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-android)
* [CLIQZ for IOS](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-ios)

## Core modules

Browser Core consist of independent modules that together form the CLIQZ product. The most important ones are:

* quick search - [modules/ui](modules/ui/sources) - heart of the CLIQZ navigation: search directly in the browser
* human web - [modules/human-web](modules/human-web/) - collects anonymous statistical data to assess website relevance and security [read more](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/human-web)
* anti tracking - [modules/antitracking](modules/antitracking) - detects and overwrites tracking data that could be used to indentify individual users [read more](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/anti-tracking)
* anti phishing -  [modules/anti-phishing](modules/anti-phishing) - detects and alerts users about forged websites and data theft attempts [read more](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/anti-phishing)
* mobile ui - [modules/mobile-ui](modules/mobile-ui) - quick search UI for Android and iOS

## Requirements

Node version required: is >= 4.x

(use  [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple node versions)

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g broccoli-cli

npm install   # to satisfy package.json
bower install # to satisfy bower.json
```

## Development

To start build system:

`./fern.js serve`

Release channel configuration file can be specified via optional argument (default is ./config/jenkins.json`):

`./fern.js serve ./configs/amo.json`

To run ember freshtab:

`cd modules/fresh-tab-frontend`
`ember serve -p 3000`

You can then access freshtab under http://localhost:3000. Every change you make in fresh-tab-frontend folder will be live reloaded. However if you change anything in freshtab folder (backend), restart browser to see your changes.

To build ember freshtab:
`cd modules/fresh-tab-frontend`
`npm run build`

By running above command you end up with minified distributed files in fresh-tab-frontend/dist folder. If you want these files to be moved into build/firefox folder, you also have to be running fern.

## Flavours

All release channels configurations files are stored in `./configs` folder. Choose your channel and build it with:

`./fern.js build ./configs/<CHANNEL_NAME>.json`

Examples:
* `./fern.js build ./configs/amo.json`
* `./fern.js build ./configs/browser.json`
* `./fern.js build ./configs/mobile.json`

## Testing

you need to build extension with `./fern.js serve ./configs/jenkins.json` configuration file in order to run tests.

Then open this URL to start tests `chrome://cliqz/content/firefox-tests/index.html`
