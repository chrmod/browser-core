# Packaging and publishing

To generate a stable version from source run `fab package:beta=False`. The default
version (`fab package`) will always be a beta version. These tasks will generate
a .xpi addon files. The difference between them is that the stable version is
generated from the latest git tag (on the current branch) and the beta version
from the latest commit.

Another difference between stable and beta is that the stable version gets updates
from stable channel and beta from beta channel. So we need to be careful to not
package a beta version if we send it to normal users.

The version is calculated from GIT tags. If we want to declare a commit stable
we give it a tag with a higher version number than the previous one (e.g. if
the last version was 0.4.08 we increment it to 0.4.09).
```
NOTE: In default git remote configuration you have to push tags explicitly.
It is recommended to push single tags that we added with `git push <remote> tag <tagname>`.
We should also explicitly get tags from remote repositories with `git fetch <remote> --tags`.
```
The beta version will append .1bN to the end (N is the commit count from last
stable version). If we made 5 commits from last stable tag (0.4.09) it will be
0.4.09.1b5.
```
If we want to set explicitly the version we can use the version argument. E.g. we
want to package a stable version on the branch we are on with the tag 0.5.25:
`fab package:beta=False,version=0.5.25`

NOTE: We should keep this format of specifying versions d.d.dd. This will allow
us not to worry about automatic updates. Even if we land on AMO we are following
all the versioning rules to have 2 channels (beta and stable) and we don't need
to change anything.
```
To publish a stable version to CDN run `fab publish:beta=False`. For the beta
version run `fab publish:beta=True` or just `fab publish`. This will package the
extension. Generate a update manifest file that is used by installed extensions
to check for newer versions. Upload the newer version to S3 and replace the old
manifest file with the new one.

This automatic versioning should allow us to recover from mistakes faster because
we have always all published versions tagged and we can easily revert to old ones.
And we always know what commit is deployed in production.
